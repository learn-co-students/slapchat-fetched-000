# SlapChat Fetched Results Controller

## Instructions

1. Add a plus button to the UINavbar.
2. When the plus button is tapped, randomly create a new `Message.' For now, I would suggest you just put a string that says what the current time is.
3. Make sure everything is displayed using `NSFetchedResultsController`
